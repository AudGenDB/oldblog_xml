I upgraded my Macs to [Lion](http://www.apple.com/lion); my favorite improvement is that we can now resize windows from any edge or corner.

(Previously, you could only change the size from the lower-right corner, so I often found myself resizing and moving and then resizing and moving and then....  Why did it take so long for them to do it properly?)
