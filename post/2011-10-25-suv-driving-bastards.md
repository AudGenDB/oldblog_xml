On my bike ride to work, in the rain, I was stopped at [stop light](http://g.co/maps/dpgfr), in the bike lane, when a big black SUV pulled up behind me and honked, wanting to turn right.  Three seconds later the light turned green.  As the guy turned behind me, he yelled out his window, "Get the hell out of the way!"

Who would not flip him off?

Madison can be great for biking, but it is not without assholes, though I suppose that is [obvious](http://walker.wi.gov/).
