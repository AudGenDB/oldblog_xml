Here's a great interview with [Jonathan Eisen](http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com) and [Nick Shockey](http://www.arl.org/sparc/about/staff/shockey.shtml) on open access publishing, nicely animated by [Jorge Cham](http://www.phdcomics.com/about.htm), who does the [Piled Higher and Deeper](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php) comic.
