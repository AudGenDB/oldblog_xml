I got some spam from Quintiles and clicked the "unsubscribe" button.  The form which came up said, "I would NOT like to receive future relevant communications from Quintiles."

I should just forget about it, but the thought of some marketing jerk writing that while preparing their crap spam just really pisses me off.
