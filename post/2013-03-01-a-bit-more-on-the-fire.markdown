The [Daily Cardinal](http://host.madison.com/daily-cardinal/) reports that [there were no overhead sprinklers](http://tinyurl.com/cuyhdtl) in the area of the fire yesterday.  Fire fighters thought that sprinklers had gone off, but it was really a broken water pipe.

And there are no sprinklers in my office, either.  I thought they were required, but I guess only in new construction.

There's a [short TV report](http://www.nbc15.com/home/headlines/Fire-Reported-at-UW-Medical-Science-Building-193836731.html) (after a commercial) at the [channel 15 site](http://www.nbc15.com).

A graduate student interviewed said, "I have multiple copies of my data, but they're all in that building."

I hope we all learn from this: Off-site backups (at least with something like [DropBox](http://www.dropbox.com)) are important.
