The other day, I was sitting on campus, in the woods overlooking Lake Mendota, reading a journal article, and a campus police officer came up to me.

The conversation went something like this:
<table cellpadding="1" >
<tbody >
<tr >

<td width="25" >
</td>
<td >_Police_:
</td>

<td >What's going on?
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td >
</td>
<td >_Me_:
</td>

<td >I'm enjoying the day.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td >
</td>
<td >_Police_:
</td>

<td >Are you staff?
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td >
</td>
<td >_Me_:
</td>

<td >I'm faculty.
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td >
</td>
<td >_Police_:
</td>

<td >I'm enjoying the day, too.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
And then he walked off.

I'm not sure who was more suspicious, him of me or me of him.  Perhaps he was thinking through the [Prof or Hobo](http://individual.utoronto.ca/somody/quiz.html) quiz.
