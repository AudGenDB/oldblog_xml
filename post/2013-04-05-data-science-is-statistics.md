When physicists do mathematics, they don't say they're doing "number science".  They're doing math.

If you're analyzing data, you're doing statistics.  You can call it data science or informatics or analytics or whatever, but it's still statistics.

If you say that one kind of data analysis is statistics and another kind is not, you're not allowing innovation.  We need to define the field broadly.

You may not like what [some statisticians](http://amstat.org) do.  You may feel they don't share your values.  They may embarrass you.  But that shouldn't lead us to abandon the term "statistics".
